## Project Context, Goals, and Consolidation Approach

Context
This project ships a shadcn/ui-based React frontend that serves static assets, reads playlist.json as the primary data source, and operates without a live backend; Supabase is disabled for now and treated as a future option only [1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/). Under a frontend-only constraint, we will implement robust client-side logic for “Top 10” ordering from createdAt and client-side search and indexing to meet MVP and Sprint 2 goals [1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/). To avoid ambiguous date behavior across browsers and locales, all createdAt values will use ISO 8601 with an explicit “Z” or offset, and we will parse only ISO strings to ensure deterministic ordering [2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date). We will use date-fns for comparisons to keep sorting and formatting pure and reliable [3](https://devdocs.io/date_fns/). For user-facing date presentation, we will render with Intl.DateTimeFormat to ensure locale- and timezone-appropriate formatting [4](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat). For search, we will prefer an indexed, client-side library that balances footprint and responsiveness for medium datasets and wire the UI with accessible combobox and listbox patterns aligned to WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices [1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).

Goals
We will deliver a consolidated priorities list spanning features and content and a staged schedule that distinguishes MVP from Sprint 2, grounded in practices appropriate to a frontend-only application. The outcome is a single, traceable backlog and a release plan that can be executed without backend dependencies while maintaining quality and accessibility across the UI.

Stakeholder synthesis and traceability
We will consolidate input from Emma, Bob, Alex, David, and Iris through a structured process that preserves traceability and aligns on outcomes. First, we will group observations and requests with thematic clustering and affinity mapping to surface common needs and pains. Next, we will build an Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) that maps one clearly defined product outcome to customer opportunities, candidate solutions, and assumption tests, making implicit assumptions explicit and enabling compare-and-contrast decisions [5](https://www.producttalk.org/opportunity-solution-trees/?srsltid=AfmBOop6vxFm8mJ9bDT7YTuyZ30ZNvP9ZRPPhpL58QXp5TEejXSlefXw). We will follow the OST process by defining the outcome at the top, interviewing and mapping opportunities, selecting a target opportunity, brainstorming multiple solutions, and breaking those into assumptions and tests to iteratively refine the tree [6](https://www.producttalk.org/opportunity-solution-trees/?srsltid=AfmBOoouLlB4m3IUfAplzHrxnEzXTYUcWH8Go-B2_fJ_EP6-tYiPvki0). We will create a User Story Map linked to OST opportunities so features are contextualized along the customer journey and we avoid a “flat backlog” of context-free items [7](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation). Traceability will be maintained by linking each backlog item to its OST node and tagging the originating stakeholder report to communicate rationale and enable meaningful feedback throughout the project [5](https://www.producttalk.org/opportunity-solution-trees/?srsltid=AfmBOop6vxFm8mJ9bDT7YTuyZ30ZNvP9ZRPPhpL58QXp5TEejXSlefXw).

Prioritization framework and communication
We will use RICE as the primary scoring method because it quantifies “impact per time worked” in a transparent, repeatable way that fits a static frontend MVP under time and resource constraints [8](https://www.productboard.com/glossary/product-prioritization-frameworks/). RICE factors and formula will be applied consistently: Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort, with the RICE Score computed as (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort [9](https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/). The Impact scale and Confidence tiers will follow Intercom’s guidance, and Effort will be estimated in whole person-months or 0.5 for well under a month [9](https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/).

RICE rubric (used for scoring and ranking)
We will apply the following rubric with one primary outcome per scoring cycle, then sort by RICE and adjust for dependencies and table-stakes transparently [9](https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/).

| Criterion | Scale/Units | Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reach | Number affected over a defined period | Use analytics or historical usage; set a consistent period |
| Impact | 3, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25 | Tie to one primary outcome (e.g., adoption or conversion) |
| Confidence | 100%, 80%, 50% | Reflect strength of data backing Reach/Impact/Effort |
| Effort | Person-months (whole numbers or 0.5) | Include design, frontend, QA, PM; round up for risk |
| RICE Score | (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort | Sort, then review dependencies/table-stakes |

To communicate inclusion/exclusion in timeboxed releases, we will add MoSCoW tags (Must/Should/Could/Won’t) to items, noting MoSCoW improves clarity but does not rank items within buckets [8](https://www.productboard.com/glossary/product-prioritization-frameworks/).

Estimation approach and quality gates
We will estimate with Planning Poker using a Fibonacci-based story point scale (1–2–3–5–8) to engage all roles, reduce anchoring via simultaneous card reveals, and converge through discussion for each backlog item [10](https://www.easyagile.com/blog/planning-poker). Story points are a relative measure of size and uncertainty, and we will not equate points to hours to avoid the common pitfall that undermines estimation’s purpose [11](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/dont-equate-story-points-to-hours). We will apply Atlassian’s guidance to keep estimates high-level, cap task size and split large items, and recalibrate using completed reference stories and team velocity for sprint forecasting [7](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation). Items will meet a Definition of Ready before sprint inclusion so goals and acceptance criteria are clear and work can start without major unknowns [12](https://nulab.com/learn/software-development/definition-of-done-vs-acceptance-criteria/). We will apply a shared Definition of Done to every increment and define item-specific Acceptance Criteria that are testable and concrete to ensure shippable quality and reduce rework [13](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/definition-of-done-vs-acceptance-criteria/). We will visualize and standardize DoD and AC on the board to enforce explicit policies, improve consistency, and provide a reliable path from “in progress” to “done” [14](https://www.agilesherpas.com/blog/definition-of-done-acceptance-criteria).

Pitfalls to avoid
- Anchoring during estimation is mitigated through simultaneous card reveals and consensus-building in Planning Poker [10](https://www.easyagile.com/blog/planning-poker).
- Do not equate story points to hours; treat points as relative size and use velocity to forecast realistically [11](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/dont-equate-story-points-to-hours).
- Avoid over-precision and detailing deep backlog items likely to change; refine regularly and involve all roles to keep the backlog healthy and ready for sprint planning [7](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation).

Transition to priorities, tasks, dependencies, and schedule
In the next sections, we will translate this foundation into a consolidated priorities list, measurable tasks with owners and estimates, explicit dependencies, and a clear MVP and Sprint 2 delivery plan aligned to the frontend-only constraints [1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/). Dependencies will be documented, such as “Top 10” ordering relying on createdAt in playlist.json with strict ISO 8601 parsing for deterministic sorting [2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date). Search will depend on index construction and tuning to balance footprint and latency for a static React app using an indexed library suited to medium datasets [15](https://lucaongaro.eu/blog/2019/01/30/minisearch-client-side-fulltext-search-engine.html). All plans will note that the backend is disabled and Supabase remains a future option to avoid hidden dependencies in MVP and Sprint 2 [1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).
